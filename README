AKFAvatar

Homepage: http://akfavatar.nongnu.org/

AKFAvatar is software mainly for GNU+Linux, where an image of an avatar 
appears on the screen and tells things written in a balloon.  First
the avatar moves slowly in from the right side. Then text is shown
in a balloon.

The program avatarsay can be used as a fancy user interface for
textconsole programs, or as a fancy text-reader or manpage-viewer.
Furthermore the program supports some basic commands, so it can be
used as a scripting-language for simple demos.

You can use the libakfavatar library from your own C programs.
There is also a rather mature Pascal-binding for
GNU-Pascal and Free Pascal.
