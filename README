AKFAvatar is to write graphical applications, where an avatar speaks text
in a balloon.  There is a program named "avatarsay", which can be used
as a fancy text-viewer.  The program "avatarsay" also understands a
small set of commands and so it can be used as a very simple scripting
language.  Furthermore you can use it as a library for your own C or
C++ programs.  And there is a language binding for GNU-Pascal and Free
Pascal, which is especially easy to use. You can even compile a lot of
Pascal programs for the avatar with no changes to the source code at
all.
