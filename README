AKFAvatar

Homepage: http://akfavatar.nongnu.org/

AKFAvatar is a fancy graphical user interface for text oriented applications,
where an avatar appears on the screen, and tells things to the user written
in a balloon.  There can also be recorded audio files, so that the user
even can hear, what it is saying.

Applications for AKFAvatar can be written in Lua, an easy to learn scripting
language.  It has an interface for C programs.
Furthermore there are bindings for Free Pascal.

AKFAvatar already comes with quite a few ready to use applications and modules.
There is for example a text-viewer, a module to make question-answer exercises
and there are many more things you could do with it...

For POSIX-compatible operating systems there is a manpage viewer, and 
there is even a terminal emulator.  So you can run many existing terminal
based programs in this fancy environment.
