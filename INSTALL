REQUIREMENTS

Needed

 * SDL-1.2.x (version 1.2.11 or higher recommended)
     http://libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
   You need the "Runtime Libraries" as well as the "Development Libraries"!

   Of course SDL needs a graphical environment to run in.
   For example the X-Window system or a Linux framebuffer-device...
    
 * An ANSI-C Compiler (gcc or others)
     http://gcc.gnu.org/

Recommended

 * SDL_image
     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
   There the Runtime Libraries are sufficient
   SDL_image in turn needs other libraries:
   libz, libpng, libjpeg, libtiff

Without SDL_image you can only use uncompressed BMP images.
SDL_image can be installed after the installation of this package.

Optional

  * GNU-Pascal or Free Pascal
      http://www.gnu-pascal.de/
      http://www.freepascal.org/


INSTALLATION

Compiling

Run "./configure". If that succeeds run "make" to create the binaries. 
There are two variants of avatarsay being compiled: 1. "avatarsay" has
been statically linked with the avatar library. You can use this to
test and play around with it before you install it. 2. "avatarsay-d"
is dynamically linked and will only work, when the library is installed. 
This is the variant that gets installed.


Compiling - special cases

To support old versions of SDL on a target machine, it might be 
necessary to use the parameter "--with-oldsdl". Note that this is
not needed if you just want to run the program on the same machine
on which you compile it.

If you want to use it on devices with a very small display, use the 
parameter "--enable-qvga" with configure. It is then compiled for 
displays with 320*240 Pixel. This feature is experimental.


Testing

The program "avatarsay" is a text reader and a simple scripting language.
Try to view this text with that program: "./avatarsay INSTALL".

You can stop avatarsay any time with the [Esc] key. On some systems you can 
toggle between window and fullscreen mode using the key [F11]. Other usefull
keys are the [Pause] key and the space key.

There are some example scripts in the package. 
Try to run "./fsdemo-en" or whatever language you prefer. Open fsdemo-en in 
a texteditor to see how to write such scripts...

The script "./avtcharset" shows which characters are available.

You can also use it as a fancy manpage reader.
Try "avtman man"...


Installing

First make sure "/usr/local/lib" is mentioned in the file
"/etc/ld.so.conf"; either directly or indirectly. Also make sure
that "/usr/local/bin" is in your "PATH" evironment variable.

Now get root privileges and run "make install" to install it in 
/usr/local. If you are low on disk space, you can instead use  
"make install-strip". This installs binaries stripped from 
debugging information.

If you want to uninstall it later, you can use the command 
"make uninstall".


SPECIAL TARGETS

With the command "make example" you can compile the program example.c.
To run the program, the library has to be already installed.
The file "example.c" is an example, which you can use to start your own
programs.


TROUBLESHOOTING

 * Problem: the system can't find the library "libavatar.so"
   Solution: first try to add /usr/local/lib or wherever you installed it 
   to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH: 
   "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib".
   
   As a more permanent solution make sure "/usr/local/lib" is directly or
   indirectly included in the file "/etc/ld.so.conf". Then run the command
   "ldconfig" with root privileges.
 
 * Problem: some characters are not shown correctly with "avatarsay"
   Solution: There are different character sets. Try to use the parameters
   "--utf-8" or "--latin1".
