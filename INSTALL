AKFAvatar

This file mainly describes the installation of AKFAvatar on GNU/Linux systems.
There are some hints for other systems at the end of this file.

REQUIREMENTS

Needed

 * SDL-1.2.x (version 1.2.11 or higher recommended)
     http://libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
   You need the "Runtime Libraries" as well as the "Development Libraries"!
   The serieses 1.3 and 2.0 are _not_ backward compatible!

   Of course SDL needs a graphical environment to run in.
   For example the X-Window-System or a Linux framebuffer-device...

 * Lua-5.2.x
     http://lua.org/

 * An ANSI-C Compiler (gcc or clang or others)
     http://gcc.gnu.org/

 * Entries for "linux" and "linux-m" in the terminal database.

   This is also needed on systems, which don't use the kernel Linux, but not 
   on Windows.  On Debian or derived distributions, you must have the package
   "ncurses-term" installed.

Recommended

 * SDL_image
     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
   There the Runtime Libraries are sufficient
   SDL_image in turn needs other libraries:
   libz, libpng, libjpeg, libtiff

X-Pixmaps (XPM), X-Bitmaps (XBM) and uncompressed BMP images are always
supported.  With SDL_image you can use lots of other image formats.
SDL_image can be installed after the installation of this package.

 * iconv
   integrated in GNU libc
 
Optional

  * GNU-Pascal or Free Pascal
      http://www.gnu-pascal.de/
      http://www.freepascal.org/


INSTALLATION

Compiling

Run "./configure". If that succeeds run "make" to create the binaries.
For Unix systems there are scripts, so you can use it without installing.


Compiling - special cases

On some systems you need the use the parameter "--with-iconv" with
"./configure" to get full iconv support (iconv is a charset-encoding
converter). This software (AKFAvatar) does an educated guess to get the
internal encoding for wchar_t right.  In some cases it might not work.
You might then provide that information with this option, like this
"--with-iconv=UCS-4LE".  On many systems you can get a list with the
command "iconv -l".  If "WCHAR_T" or "wchar_t" is on the list, use that.

If you know that SDL_image is always installed, then you can provide the
parameter "--enable-link-sdl-image" to directly link to it, instead 
of loading it at runtime.

If you want to use it on devices with a small display (eg. netbooks), use the
parameter "--enable-size=vga" with configure. 
The value "vga" means a size of 640*480 pixels.


Installing

On a GNU/Linux system first make sure "/usr/local/lib" is mentioned in
the file "/etc/ld.so.conf"; either directly or indirectly. Also make sure
that "/usr/local/bin" is in your "PATH" evironment variable.

Now get root privileges and run "make install" to install it in
/usr/local. If you are low on disk space, you can instead use
"make install-strip".

If you want to uninstall it later, you can use the command
"make uninstall".


SPECIAL TARGETS

With the command "make example" you can compile the program example.c.
The file "example.c" is an example, which you can use to start your own
programs.


OTHER SYSTEMS

 * BSD
   AKFAvatar is known to be compilable with FreeBSD 6.2.  To get iconv
   support, install libiconv and use "./configure --with-iconv".

 * Windows / ReactOS
   These systems are just partly supported.  I provide binaries which are
   build with a crosscompiler.  I haven't compiled them directly under
   Windows yet, so you're on your own here.  I'm sorry.
   Especially the terminal emulation doesn't work on Windows.

   The Windows-specific charsets like "WINDOWS-1252", also known as "MS-ANSI"
   are supported since version 0.19.0.
