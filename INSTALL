AKFAvatar

This file mainly describes the installation of AKFAvatar on GNU/Linux systems.
There are some hints for other systems at the end of this file.

REQUIREMENTS

Needed

 * SDL-1.2.11 or higher
     http://libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
   You need the "Runtime Libraries" as well as the "Development Libraries"!
   The serieses 1.3 and 2.0 are _not_ backward compatible!

   Of course SDL needs a graphical environment to run in.
   For example the X-Window-System or a Linux framebuffer-device...

 * Lua-5.2.x
     http://lua.org/

 * A C99 Compiler (gcc and clang tested)
     http://gcc.gnu.org/
     http://clang.llvm.org/

 * Entries for "linux" and "linux-m" in the terminal database.

   This is also needed on systems, which don't use the kernel Linux, but not 
   on Windows.  On Debian or derived distributions, you must have the package
   "ncurses-term" installed.

Optional

  * Free Pascal

INSTALLATION

Compiling

Run "./configure". If that succeeds run "make" to create the binaries.
You can use it without installing.


Compiling - special cases

If you want to use it on devices with a small display (eg. netbooks), use the
parameter "--enable-size=vga" with configure. 
The value "vga" means a size of 640*480 pixels.


Installing

You can use it without installing.

But if you want to install it:
On a GNU/Linux system first make sure "/usr/local/lib" is mentioned in
the file "/etc/ld.so.conf"; either directly or indirectly. Also make sure
that "/usr/local/bin" is in your "PATH" evironment variable.

Now get root privileges and run "make install" to install it in
/usr/local. If you are low on disk space, you can instead use
"make install-strip".

If you want to uninstall it later, you can use the command
"make uninstall".


SPECIAL TARGETS

With the command "make example" you can compile the program example.c.
The file "example.c" is an example, which you can use to start your own
programs.


OTHER SYSTEMS

 * BSD
   Older versions of AKFAvatar were tested on FreeBSD.

 * Windows / ReactOS
   These systems are just partly supported.  I provide binaries which are
   build with a crosscompiler.  I haven't compiled them directly under
   Windows yet, so you're on your own here.  I'm sorry.
   Especially the terminal emulation doesn't work on Windows.

   Some Windows-specific charsets like "WINDOWS-1252" are supported since
   version 0.19.0.
