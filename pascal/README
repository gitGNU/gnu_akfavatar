You can use the Avatar for your pascal programs

First of all the avatar library must already be installed on your system.
You also need the file "avatar.pas". That is not automatically installed,
because there is no standard directory for that. But it is found, if it 
simply is in the current directory.

Be careful "avatar.pas" should never be in the same directory with
"avatar.c", because both produce a file named "avatar.o".


SIMPLE USE CASES

In this directory you will find the scripts "gpcavatar" and "fpcavatar".
If you have GNU-Pascal (gpc) just try this: "./gpcavatar example.pas"
This should compile a program "example".

You can compile any program, that just uses plain standard input/output
like this. There are no changes to the source-code necessary!
Just make sure, the program doesn't use the CRT unit or any other
non-standard output facillities.

That is easy, isn't it?


INSTALLING

Have a look into the scripts. There are some variables you should adapt
to your needs. Copy the scripts into "/usr/local/bin", so you can use
them from anywhere. Copy the file "avatar.pas" to where you want to
have your personal units and make sure that directory is listed in the
scripts.
