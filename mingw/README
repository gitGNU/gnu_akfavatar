This Makefile has probably to be tweaked for your needs.
I use it for a MinGW32 crosscompiler under GNU+Linux.

When crosscompiling, please keep in mind, that you have to have the SDL
installed for the *target* platform.

It builds:
  avatar.dll:        dynamic link library
  libavatar.dll.a:   import library for avatar.dll
  avatar.def:        definitions file for avatar.dll
  libavatar.a:       static library
