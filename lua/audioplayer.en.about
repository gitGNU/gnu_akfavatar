Audio player for AKFAvatar

Supported audio formats: Ogg Vorbis, Wave, AU
Supported playlist formats: M3U, PLS

This program can be used interactively, or files can be given as arguments.

When you select "play all..." or use several files as arguments, then 
Playlists are ignored.  Playlists also cannot refer to other Playlists.

Network adresses may be supported, when you have the tool "curl" installed in
your PATH.  But this doesn't work on all platforms.
