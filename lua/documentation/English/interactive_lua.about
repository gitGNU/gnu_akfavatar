Using Lua interactively with AKFAvatar.

This could for example be used as a calculator.  When you start a line with
an equal sign ('=') then the result(s) of the expression is shown.
For example, when you enter '=10/4' it prints '2.5'.

Note that it might show a different character for the decimal point, depending
on your language settings.  But when you want to enter a decimal fraction, you
have to use the American notation with a point.

You can define your own variables.  For example one Megabyte is 2^20 Bytes.
So enter 'MB=2^20'.  Now you can use it in your calculations.  If you want to
know what 5 Megabytes is in Bytes, enter '=5*MB', the result is '5242880'.
Please note that Lua is case sensitive.  That means for example that 'MB' and
'mb' are two different variables.

Starting lines with the equal sign is a special feature of the interactive
shell. It can not be used in scripts.

Your normal prompt is a '>'.  But when you enter an incomplete command, then
you'll get a different prompt that looks like this '>>'.  Then you can continue
to complete your entry.  If you end up on the secondary prompt by accident, then
simply press <Enter>.  This cancels the previous entry.

You can define your own functions.  For example:
  > function circle_area(radius)
  >> return radius^2 * math.pi
  >> end
  > =3 * circle_area(5)
  235.61944901923

You can use any Lua command, including the AKFAvatar commands. For example you
can set a name for the avatar.  Try this:
  > avt.set_avatar_name("Hugo")

Or if you don't want to have an avatar at all use 
  > avt.avatar_image("none")

To get a female avatar use
  > avt.avatar_image_file(avt.search("female_user.xpm"))

You can do a lot more...  Just experiment with it... â˜º
