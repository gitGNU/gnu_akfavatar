base64-encode

Base 64 is a method to encode binary data with printable ASCII characters.

For Lua-AKFAvatar this can be used to embed binary data like sounds or images
in Lua scripts.  See the file "akfavatar/positive.lua" as an example.

The image formats XPM and XBM are already plain ASCII, so they don't need to be
encoded.
