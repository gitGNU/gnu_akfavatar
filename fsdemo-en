improve the software.

More precisely, it refers to four kinds of freedom,
for the users of the software:

[size 10, 56]
0. The freedom _to run_ the program, _for any purpose._
1. The freedom _to study_ how the program works, and 
   adapt it to your needs.
   Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
2. The freedom to _redistribute copies_ so you can help 
   your neighbor.
3. The freedom to _improve_ the program, and release your 
   improvements to the public, so that the whole 
   community benefits.
   Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

completely free operating system.
