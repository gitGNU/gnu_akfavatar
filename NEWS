* AKFAvatar 0.20.0

  - The program avatarsay was removed
    all it could do can be done with lua-akfavatar now
  - documentation now consists of manpages and textfiles
    wich can be displayed in lua-akfavatar directly
  - making demos became simpler again,
    there is no need to specify the balloon-size anymore,
    but therefore effectpause/back don't work anymore
  - new lua modules available for better UTF-8 support,
    terminal-emulation and the Ogg Vorbis audio format
  - the terminal-emulation has a different, enhanced APC interface


* AKFAvatar 0.19.0

  - Lua support with program lua-akfavatar
    use "./configure --disable-lua" to build without Lua
  - largely improved support for charset-encodings under Windows
    (still behind GNU/Linux, but tremendously better than before)
  - text-input has full line-editing features
  - fix: on text-input the input area gets cleared
  - title can have international characters if avt_mb_encoding is
    called before avt_initialize (but not relyable)
  - the pager can handle binary junk better
  - filechooser: path can be entered manually
  - filechooser: on windows ask for drive letter only when
    going beyond the root directory
  - ./configure: experimental support for "--host=mingw" and "--host=x86"
    (but don't expect it to work out of the box)
  - optimizations

  API changes:
   - new functions: avt_tell, avt_tell_len, avt_tell_mb, avt_tell_mb_len,
     avt_markup, avt_get_mb_encoding, avt_set_auto_margin, avt_get_auto_margin,
     avt_printable, avt_audio_playing
   - avt_auto_margin: marked deprecated, use avt_set_auto_argin instead
   - avt_free_audio: when the given sound is playing, stops it
   - avt_get_key: supports some function keys
