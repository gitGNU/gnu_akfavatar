* AKFAvatar 0.19.0

  - Lua support with program lua-akfavatar
  - ./configure --disable-lua to buld without Lua
  - text-input has full line-editing features
  - fix: on text input the input area gets cleared
  - title can have international characters if avt_mb_encoding is
    called before avt_initialize
  - the pager can handle binary junk better
  - filechooser: path can be entered manually
  - filechooser: on windows ask for drive letter only when
    going beyond the root directory
  - some ignorable Unicode characters are ignored now
  - ./configure: experimental support for --host=mingw and --host=x86
    (don't expect it to work out of the box)

  API changes:
   - avt_tell(), avt_tell_mb(): new functions
   - avt_markup(): new function
   - avt_free_audio(): when that sound is playing, stops it
