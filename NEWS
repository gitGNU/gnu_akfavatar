* AKFAvatar testing

  - Uses Lua-5.2 now, no longer compatible with 5.1
  - Lua modules don't define globals anymore
  - The source code is compatible with C++ compilers again
  - Data files are put in a separate directory and Lua has a search function
    for it (scripts have to be adapted!)
  - Some more audio files

  C-API changes:
  - new functions: avt_delay
  - avtaddons:
    - avta_arch_get_member: new function
    - avta_arch_get_data: rewritten

  Lua-API changes:
  - new functions: avt.delay, avt.search
  - new variable: avt.datapath
  - Module "akfavatar-graphic"
    - gr:new() accepts name for background color
    - gr:put() optimized for same width, position is optional now
    - new methods: gr:shift_vertically(), gr:shift_horizontally(),
      gr:put_transparency()

* AKFAvatar 0.21.2

  This is again mainly a bugfix release, only few changes

  - the filechooser uses the systems character encoding,
    so does the audioplayer
  - empty string is always accepted as encoding (system's encoding)
  - fixed avt_recode_buffer, this also fixes setting the title/shortname
  - the audioplayer doesn't crash if it gets an empty list
  - updated documentation

* AKFAvatar 0.21.1

  This is mainly a bugfix release, only few changes

  - fixes two bugs where characters were lost
    (one was because a buffer was too small, but there was
    no buffer overflow, so it was harmless)
  - the mouse pointer is not hidden by default anymore
    this caused problems on some systems
  - in the binary packages are no developer files anymore
    Lua developing is still possible, but C or Pascal developers
    should install from the source package
  - terminal.lua defines a small computer as avatar
  - Windows: binary Lua modules have version infos as metadata
    (only those which depend on AKFAvatar)

* AKFAvatar 0.21.0

  - if a script is started from the filechooser an error in the script
    doesn't stop the whole program
  - terminal emulation optimized, some new codes supported
  - new sound for the bell
  - in Lua loading a sound now always invokes the garbage collector

  C-API changes:
    - all deprecated functions removed (told you so)
    - code refactoring:
      - use stdbool.h - no longer avt_bool_t, AVT_TRUE, AVT_FALSE
      - an external iconv implementation is now the default
    - new functions: avt_recode, avt_recode_buffer, avt_mb_decode_buffer,
      avt_mb_encode_buffer

  Lua-API changes:
    - new module "akfavatar.lang": for multilingual applications
    - new functions: avt.recode, avt.launch

  Pascal-API changes:
    - should be more robust now
    - new functions: Playing, ShowRawImage, ImageMaxWidth, ImageMaxHeight,
      getBackgroundColor


* AKFAvatar 0.20.0

  - The program avatarsay was removed
    all it could do can be done with lua-akfavatar now
  - documentation now consists of manpages and textfiles
    wich can be displayed in lua-akfavatar directly
  - making demos became simpler again,
    there is no need to specify the balloon-size anymore,
    but therefore effectpause/back doesn't work anymore.
    (And it's not documented, yet. - see example files.)
  - lua-akfavatar can be compiled as module
  - new lua modules available for better UTF-8 support,
    terminal-emulation and the Ogg Vorbis audio format
    and a graphic module for drawing images
  - the terminal-emulation has a different, enhanced APC interface

  C-API changes:
    - Changed definition of avt_image_t and avt_audio_t
    - New type avt_char:
        avt_put_char() replaces avt_put_character()
        avt_is_printable() replaces avt_printable()
        avt_key() replaces avt_get_key()
    - new functions: avt_add_raw_audio_data, avt_pause_audio,
      avt_get_newline_mode, avt_ticks, avt_show_raw_image,
      avt_get_background_color, avt_image_max_width, avt_image_max_height,
      avt_get_font_size, get_font_char
    - avtaddons.h: new functions: avta_load_vorbis_file, avta_load_vorbis_data
    - modified behaviour:
      - avt.navigate: reacts when sound ends
    - deprecated: avt_show_gimp_image - use avt_show_raw_image

  Lua-API changes:
    - new functions:
      avt.colors, avt.pause_audio, avt.directory_entries, avt.entry_type,
      avt.silent, avt.load_base_audio_file, avt.load_base_audio_string,
      avt.ticks
    - modified behaviour:
      - avt.menu as alias for avt.long_menu can do more
      - avt.load_audio_file, avt.load_audio_string:
        return nil on error, can be enhanced
      - playing sounds are protected from the garbage collector
      - avt.navigate: reacts when sound ends


* AKFAvatar 0.19.0

  - Lua support with program lua-akfavatar
    use "./configure --disable-lua" to build without Lua
  - largely improved support for charset-encodings under Windows
    (still behind GNU/Linux, but tremendously better than before)
  - text-input has full line-editing features
  - fix: on text-input the input area gets cleared
  - title can have international characters if avt_mb_encoding is
    called before avt_initialize (but not relyable)
  - the pager can handle binary junk better
  - filechooser: path can be entered manually
  - filechooser: on windows ask for drive letter only when
    going beyond the root directory
  - ./configure: experimental support for "--host=mingw" and "--host=x86"
    (but don't expect it to work out of the box)
  - optimizations

  API changes:
   - new functions: avt_tell, avt_tell_len, avt_tell_mb, avt_tell_mb_len,
     avt_markup, avt_get_mb_encoding, avt_set_auto_margin, avt_get_auto_margin,
     avt_printable, avt_audio_playing
   - avt_auto_margin: marked deprecated, use avt_set_auto_argin instead
   - avt_free_audio: when the given sound is playing, stops it
   - avt_get_key: supports some function keys
